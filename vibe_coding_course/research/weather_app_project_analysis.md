## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates several important concepts:

1. **API Integration** - How to connect to weather data services
2. **User Interface Design** - Creating a clean, intuitive interface
3. **Data Visualization** - Displaying weather information effectively
4. **Error Handling** - Managing potential issues like invalid locations
5. **Deployment Preparation** - Getting the app ready for sharing

## Why This Project Is Suitable for Our Course

This weather app project is ideal for our vibe coding course for several reasons:

1. **Accessibility**: Suitable for complete beginners with no prior coding experience
2. **Practical Utility**: Creates a useful application that solves a real need
3. **Comprehensive Learning**: Covers multiple aspects of development
4. **Quick Results**: Achieves a working application in minutes
5. **Extendable**: Can be enhanced with additional features as skills improve

## Implementation Approach

For our step-by-step guide, we'll adapt this project with the following approach:

1. **Simplified Setup**: Clear instructions for absolute beginners
2. **Detailed Prompts**: Specific prompts to use with Cursor AI
3. **Visual Guidance**: Screenshots at each major step
4. **Explanation**: Clear explanations of what's happening behind the scenes
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
6. **Extension Ideas**: Suggestions for enhancing the project

## Required Resources

To complete this project, students will need:

1. **Cursor AI**: Installed and configured
2. **Python**: Basic installation (will be handled through Cursor)
3. **Weather API**: Access to a free weather data API
4. **Internet Connection**: For API access and Cursor AI functionality

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis, we'll create a detailed step-by-step guide that walks students through building this weather app using Cursor AI and vibe coding techniques. The guide will focus on the process of communicating with AI to generate code rather than writing code manually, emphasizing the core principles of vibe coding.
